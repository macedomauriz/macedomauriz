When deploying applications, especially those involving Docker containers, the workflow sometimes involves pushing your images to Amazon ECR and pulling them onto your EC2 instances. 

However, you also need to manage your configuration files, such as `docker-compose-prod.yml`, on the EC2 instance to orchestrate your containers. 

Handling multi-line content for these configuration files can be tricky. Traditional methods often rely on external storage solutions like S3 buckets or managing SSH connections, each with its drawbacks. 

In this guide, weâ€™ll explore a streamlined approach that avoids these issues by directly transferring multi-line configuration files to your EC2 instances using GitHub Actions and AWS Systems Manager (SSM).

## The Problem

Deploying configuration files can be cumbersome due to:

**Complex Multi-line Content**: JSON struggles with multi-line strings, particularly when they include special characters and quotes.

**Clutter from External Storage**: Storing files in buckets like S3 can lead to clutter and additional management overhead.

**Security Concerns with SSH**: Using SSH for file transfers requires opening extra ports, which can introduce security vulnerabilities.

## Solution Overview

Our approach addresses these issues by:

**Base64 Encoding the Configuration File**: This method converts the Docker Compose file into a single-line base64 string, making it easy to pass through JSON.

**Avoiding External Storage**: Instead of relying on S3 buckets, we use GitHub Actions to encode and pass the file directly.

**Minimizing SSH Dependencies**: By using AWS SSM for deployment, we avoid opening additional SSH ports, thus enhancing security.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

1. Checkout Code

Start by checking out the code from your repository:

```yaml showLineNumbers
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

2. Configure AWS Credentials

Set up AWS credentials to interact with AWS services:

```yaml showLineNumbers
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_ARN }}
    role-session-name: GitHub_to_AWS_via_FederatedOIDC
    aws-region: ${{ env.REGION }}
```

3. Encode Docker Compose File

Convert the Docker Compose file into a base64 string and store it in an environment variable:

```yaml showLineNumbers
- name: Encode docker-compose-prod.yml
  id: encode_file
  run: |
    base64 docker-compose-prod.yml | tr -d '\n' > docker-compose-prod.yml.b64
    echo "DOCKER_COMPOSE_YML=$(cat docker-compose-prod.yml.b64)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

4. Deploy to EC2

Send the encoded content to the EC2 instance, decode it, and write it to the file system:

```yaml showLineNumbers
- name: Deploy to EC2
  run: |
    aws ssm send-command \
    --instance-ids "$INSTANCE_ID" \
    --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" \
    --parameters '{
      "commands": [
        "sudo mkdir -p /path/to/",
        "echo '${{ env.DOCKER_COMPOSE_YML }}' | base64 -d > /path/to/docker-compose-prod.yml"
      ]
    }' \
    --region ${{ env.REGION }}
```

Integrate this approach into your CI/CD pipeline to improve deployment efficiency and maintain a clean, secure environment.
